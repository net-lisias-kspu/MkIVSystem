# Mark IV Spaceplane System Unofficial

**THIS REPOSITORY LOST HIS MEANINGFULNESS**. It's not needed anymore, and will be moved to the "attic" in the near future.

Please see the UPSTREAM below for the Official Version.

## Description

This part pack adds a new lifting-body fuselage system for aircraft heavily inspired by an iconic 60s sci-fi design. It's designed to fit 2.5m parts in a cargo bay easily, and 3.75m parts snugly. The parts are done in a stockalike style and the author had attempted to be as close to Porkjet's Mk2 and Mk3 parts as he can. Highlights include:

* A full fuselage system in the Mark IV standard, from cockpits to cargo bays
* A full set of 2.5m engines including multimode engines and several jet engines
* A lot of 2.5m aerospace support equipment, like nacelles, intakes, precoolers and fuel tanks
* Specialized propeller engines, including two turboprops for high efficiency flight and several electric-drive lift fans. Build a Laythe skybase!
* All the parts are fully configured to work with the Community Tech  Tree in its highest aerospace nodes.

		- The parts in this pack are placed primarily in the Heavy Aerodynamics, Experimental Aerodynamics and Aerospace Tech tree.
	+ [Raster Prop Monitor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105821-14x-rasterpropmonitor-still-putting-the-a-in-iva-v0305-11-june-2018/)([GitHub](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/)) plus [ASET Props](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116430-aset-props-pack-v15-for-the-modders-who-create-iva/)([SpaceDock](https://spacedock.info/mod/1204/ASET%20Props))
		- Though not included, you should install RasterPropMonitor to get the full cockpit experience. I did my best without it, but static MFDs just aren't awesome. 
	+ [FAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/19321-131-ferram-aerospace-research-v01591-liepmann-4218/)([GitHub](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research)) / [NEAR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/78013-090near-a-simpler-aerodynamics-model-v131-121614/)([GitHub](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research/releases/tag/NEAR_v1.3.1)) Support:
		- As the author doesn't personally use FAR or NEAR, he don't have a handle on the full flight characteristics of the parts in these mods. Community members have contributed information, so there is an included ModuleManager patch that should get things to work. He's open to changing this if stuff is missing.
