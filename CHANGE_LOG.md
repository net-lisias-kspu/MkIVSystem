# Mark IV Spaceplane System :: Change Log

* 2015-0724: 2.0.0 (ChrisAdderley) for KSP 1.0.4
	+ Remodel and retexture of all 1.x generation parts parts. Notable changes:
	+ Increase in size of approximately 25% for all parts
	+ Mk4 Cockpit and most adapters now have 1.25m attach nodes on each side to mount new shoulder pieces or standard 1.25m parts
	+ Adapters have been reworked to different sizes due to size increases
	+ Fuselages and cargo bays are now available in 1x, 2x and 4x sizes, with lengths matching Mk3 parts
	+ Most fuel-containing parts can now switch fuels in the VAB (usually between LF, LF/O, LF/MP and LF/O/MP)
	+ Service bay has been reworked, now carries less RCS fuel, but has openable hatches and is better for storage
	+ Many parts are now hollow to work better with cargo stowage
	+ Yellowjacket VTOL engine now has shroud, opens and closes when active/shutdown
	+ New Parts:
		- KE-90 Turbofan Engine: 2.5m basic jet engine
		- KE-4 Turbojet Engine: 2.5m high performance engine
		- B.R.O.A.D.S.W.O.R.D Multimode Engine: 2.5m multimodal engine
		- Advanced Precooler
		- Heavy Engine Nacelle
		- Heavy Engine Nacelle XL
		- Large Turbofan Intake
		- Advanced Shock Intake
		- Mk4 Aerodynamic Shoulder

* 2014-1215: 1.1.2 (ChrisAdderley) for KSP 0.25
	+ Fixed a major bug in the MM configs that would cause all parts to always have their FAR/DRE/TS patches loaded
	+ Fixed low impact tolerance of Mk4 Cockpit, Crew Cabin and Drone Core
	+ Fixed the dry mass of the Extended LFO and LF fuselages being 1/3 too low
	+ Fixed a few more FAR omissions
	+ Fixed attach symmetry on the Mk4 Triple Adapter
	+ Improved the look of the Mk4 Cockpit's intakes
	+ Disembarking from the Mk4 Cockpit should now be prioritized to the front hatch
	+ Hatches from the Crew Cabin and Cockpit should be easier to click on
* 2014-1211: 1.1.1 (ChrisAdderley) for KSP 0.25
	+ Fixed DRE patch for SCIMITARs being wrong
	+ Changed how MM patches for mod compatability are applied for easier end-user tweaking
	+ Increased area of Heavy Structural Intakes slightly (about 1.25x as effective)
	+ Increased strength of Cargo Bay connections
	+ Added intakes to the Mk4 Cockpit (~1 Shock Cone intake effectiveness)
	+ Added custom SFX to the SCIMITAR
	+ Added Yellowjacket VTOL jet engine - high thrust, overheats easily
* 2014-1208: 1.1.0 (ChrisAdderley) for KSP 0.25
	+ Added basic Deadly Reentry MM configs
	+ Added basic TweakScale MM configs
	+ Fixed a clipping error in the Mk4 RPM Cockpit IVA
	+ Fixed intake area for Heavy Structural Intakes
	+ Adjusted thrust and thrust curve for SCIMITAR engine in FAR/NEAR
	+ Adjusted and optimized colliders on LFO/LF Fuselages, Cargo Bay, Crew Cabin, Cockpit, Service Compartment, Drone Core, Adapters, Tails
	+ Adjusted all cargo bay floors, hopefully things will fall through less frequently
	+ Redid colliders on cargo doors and service compartment top, should be more symmetrical now
	+ All Mk4 part connections now use size 3 attach nodes instead of size 2 (should decrease wobble)
	+ Cargo tail, all adapters, all tail pieces, nosecones can no longer be surface attached
	+ Fixed surface attach node on Crew Cabin, LF Fuselage, LFO Fuselage, Cargo Bay
	+ Parts can no longer be attached to the Mk4 docking nosecone
	+ Added missing description to Mk4 nosecone
	+ Fixed a mesh seam on the Mk4 Triple Adapter
